# Masterful Documentation

This repo holds the IPYNB notebooks that are the source for the guides and tutorials rendered as HTML pages at http://www.masterfulai.com/docs. You can git clone this repo to get access to the IPYNB so you can run the notebooks locally, or visit http://www.masterfulai.com/docs to see the rendered HTML, all of which also have a download button to get the IPYNB source.
