    "learning: architecture, data, optimization, regularization,\n",
    "and semi-supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture** is the structure of weights, biases, and activations\n",
    "that define a model. In this example, the architecture is defined by the model you created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** is the input used to train the model. In this example, you\n",

    "More advanced usages of the Masterful AutoML platform can take into account unlabeled and synthetic\n",
    "data as well, using a variety of different techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization** means finding the best weights for a model and\n",
    "training data. Optimization is different from regularization because\n",
    "optimization does not consider generalization to unseen data. The\n",
    "central challenge of optimization is speed - find the best weights\n",
    "faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization** means helping a model generalize to data it has\n",
    "not yet seen. Another way of saying this is that regularization is\n",
    "about fighting overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semi-Supervision** is the process by which a model can be trained\n",
    "using both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when using Masterful is to learn the optimal set of\n",
    "parameters for each of the five buckets above. You start by learning\n",
    "the architecture and data parameters of the model and training dataset. In the code below, you are telling Masterful that your model is performing a classification task (`masterful.enums.Task.CLASSIFICATION`) with 10 labels (`num_classes=NUM_CLASSES`), and that the input range of the image features going into your model are in the range [0,255] (`input_range=masterful.enums.ImageRange.ZERO_255`).
