    "\n",

    "the labels into a format Masterful understands. There are two steps\n",
    "involved here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Convert the labels to Masterful format\n",
    "* Step 2: Pad the labels and images to uniform sizes so they can be batched\n",
    "\n",
    "Masterful understands several different label and bounding box formats.\n",
    "See [DataParams](../api/api_data.rst#masterful.data.DataParams) for the\n",
    "specific formats supported. In this example, you are going to use the\n",
    "Tensorflow bounding box format, which defines bounding boxes in terms\n",
    "of min and max values, normalized into the range [0,1]. Specifically, the\n",
    "bounding boxes are of the form [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].\n",
    "\n",
    "Masterful extends this label format to support padding out the labels,\n",
    "as well as multiple bounding boxes per object. A Masterful Object Detection\n",
    "label for a single example has the form `[num_boxes, label]` where\n",
    "label is a `tf.float32` vector of the form `[valid, ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax, one_hot_class]`.\n",
    "`valid` is a `float` value of either 1.0 or 0.0, and is used to represent\n",
    "padded bounding boxes. For example, a value of 1.0 represents a \"good\" bounding\n",
    "box, and a value of 0.0 represents \"padding\" added to the labels in\n",
    "order to support batching. Labels whose `valid` value is 0.0 are ignored during\n",
    "training. For example, if you have 10 classes in your dataset, then\n",
    "the labels for a single example will have the shape `[num_boxes, 1 + 4 + 10]`.\n",
    "If we allow a maximum number of bounding boxes per example of 20 (`max_bounding_boxes = 20`),\n",
    "and use a batch size of 8 (`batch_size = 8`), then the per-batch\n",
    "labels will have the shape `[batch_size, max_bounding_boxes, 1 + 4 + 10]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masterful provides a utility to help you convert the labels into Masterful\n",
    "format, and prepare them for padding and batching. All you need to do\n",
    "is extract the bounding boxes and class labels from the dataset and Masterful\n",
    "will handle the conversion for you."
